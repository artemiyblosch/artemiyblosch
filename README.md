Random stuff will be there:
-pylobotomy: The most sus way to code in python.
    Instead of cycles use iterators, instead of normal code use "def main(): pass" and stack decorators on top of it.
    Infinite lists and linked list, but it's an exception.
    pass_do for the side effects, but you want to keep the value.
    Dictionary, but with default value for conditions.
    And maybe some others?
